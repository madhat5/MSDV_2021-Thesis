- distinction notes
    - what propels vs what justifies writing for the visual piece
    - what aspect of data vis can visualiation provide to this paper (vs non-visual papers)
    - what is really my contribution to this topic/research?
        - eg: http://richardthe.com/BodiesInMotion
    - what contributes more?
        - fingers vs forearms?
        - thumb/pinch strength
    - reduced complexity to mediated language
        eg: > http://richardthe.com/BodiesInMotion
    - https://www.researchnewschool.com/hrpp
        - for building forms to gather data from constituents
    - are there other apps?
        - https://www.climbernews.com/best-hangboard-app/
    - is there a way to make a visual that is useful?
        - how would a coach use this?
    - can i get data from comps?/from gym
        - eg how many times x grip is used?
        - are there ways to acquire data that already exists
        - how can i normalize technique?
            - eg looking at youtube vids and breadking down most used grips/positions
            - what is my input that validates my output?
    - i'm building a comparitive analysis
        - what is the action piece? 
            - automating people to use my interface?
                - eg setting up ipad to hang off of: how does this help with strength assessment
                    - ipad/iphone + camera to capture fingers?
                - can i game-ify the test/protocol and give feedback


- focus on finger planks as additional exercise
- build interface using pressure pads for both hangs and planks

- [collect notes from class]()

- can i/ do i need to calculate surface area
    - compute with pressure?
    > https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/27yzxp/how_does_tread_on_tires_increase_grip_when_they/

- can /should i pivot? (like justin/luella mentioned. first idea too focused/feels ambitious given time restraints, data acquisition)
    - a comparison of the world's hardest climbs vs the rise in popularity (# of gyms, # events, etc) + scientific research aka `are climbers actually getting stronger? and by how much`
        - `are climbers sending harder boulders compared to the past? has the level of outdoor climbs matched the increase in literature and popularity of the sport?`
            - are climbers getting stronger or are there more strong climbers?
            - are climbers getting significantly stronger or just a little more?
            - where are the strongest climbers coming from? (eg East African Runners)
            - are climbers getting stronger at sport vs boulder vs both?
        - visual map of the world's hardest climbs (cf mountain project) + timeline of first (2nd 3rd ascents)
        - another question to answer within, the gap between famous first ascents and repeats
        - how many people are actually achieving this? (funnel)
            - limit to first 3 ascents for details? then list how many total attempts on route?
        - gender on first ascents? hardest climbs?
            - who's stronger men vs women
        - is there an age for strength?
        - types of pro climbers
            - comp vs outdoor heavy
        - publication timeline
            - research papers
            - editorials (date of first publication)
            - books, etc
        - WR/top world climbs
            - cf: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_world_record_progression
        - discussion portion 
            - mention future research to tackle
                - eg original question of finger strength
                - theory of grip + core + tension + flexibility
            - is there space/time for a "test your strength?" component
                - where i bring in a hands on portion of the app (pressure strip)
        - interactivity
            - input max level achieved to see what percentile you fall in?
            - informal gym survey (anonymous)
                - do you think climbers are getting stronger or there are more strong climbers?
        - can i add a guide (on the side), presupposes down scrolling thesis presentation   
            - guide represents edge (in mm). as you progress down the study, the edge reduces (strength capabililty to hold on has increase)
    - Daniel feedback
        - by analysing performance data
        - cross polination to other sports?
        - what is strength in climbing?
            - that's the question
            - answering this as a conversation across age/gender/ability/sports?
                - think "old man strength"
                - olympic setting is good for the rules/nomenclature/how its going to be evaluated
                - strength tailored for olympics (eg including speed) vs strength according to actual sport


- outline info: (https://www.researchgate.net/post/What-is-the-difference-between-results-discussion-and-conclusions-in-writing-a-research-paper)
    - Results section: In this section simply present what you found,
    - Discussion section: (a) Try to explain "What do your results mean?", and (b) how they relate to the literature,
    - Conclusions section: Re-state the main points in a new concise way that you want your readers to remember.
