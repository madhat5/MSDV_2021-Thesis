- get GP involved

- get Geek Climber involved?

- gather climber profiles
    - how long climbing? frequency? 
        - (sets experience levels)? 
    - max grade? 
        - target/goal grade? if applicable...
    - types (boulder, lead, etc)?
    - hangboarding yes/no? frequency?
    - other training? (eg stretching, core, general strength work, cardio/type, etc)

- create 2 groups for study?
    - based on experience leves
    - slightly diff protocols, but still works fingers + pinch + forearm

- Topic:
    - `the forearm components that affect the rate of force development in climbers`
    - `Increasing the Rate of Force Development in climbers of various levels`

- Questions:
    - `can developing more pinch strength and forearm strength in addition to finger strength contribute to an increse in rate of force development in climbers of various levels?`
    - `can finger planks in addition to hangboarding contribute to an increse in rate of force development in climbers of various levels?`

- brief Cliff & Julien

- work angles on hangs (135 to 90)
    - use fitness bands for less experienced groups
        - work until can do without band at 135
    - work from 135 to 90 (no weights?)*
        - or keep at x angle + add weights?

- data
    - primary:
        - GP
        - french/spanish researchers
        - cliff's contacts
            - victor (data)
            - steep rock west (sensors)
    - secondary
        - research papers
    - tertiary
        - climbing books
        - strength training books
        - other sports

- anonymous data collection?

- make spreadsheet for secondary sources

- Mural notes + comments
    - `notes`
        - what are main components that climbers at different levels could work on that would improve strength/technique
        - context: rock-climbing, gaining popularity (maybe going to be in olympics as races), people trying to shave off seconds, articles have been written about grip strength and technique (3 vs 4 fingers) 
        - Rate of Force Development. considering including forearm strength in addition to the articles about finger strength
        - question: how effective are these new techniques with non-elite climbers as compared to elite? in combination with forearm
        - idea: use current research to start off and conduct own research
        - reach out to current researchers for input
        - comparing grip strength across grip strength-required sports (i.e. baseball, football)
        - what subject groups are appropriate? (eg beginner, intermediate, elite)
        - Interesting details: being able to collect raw data
        - considering using rock climbers at personal gym as subjects, because articles were only written about elite climbers and therefore are incomplete
        - questions to consider: how many subjects would be necessary to be able to draw conclusions or compare research
    - `my comments`
        - primary audience: climbers, climbing researchers
            - knowledge: average/above average knowledge of the sport of climbing
            - response: gain a better understanding of the methods of building climbing strenght. Put into practice/test the findings and provide a critique
        - data: real world data collection, with various experience levels. Data can be found with both previously conducted studies (for comparison), and gathering new data from climbing gyms in NY. 
            - Primary source is a participant in the study
            - Secondary sources: previous studies conducted on finger strength in climbing.
    - `peer comments`
        - What if you re-considered this entirely from a data-driven perspective geared towards coaches/commentators and base this on any quantitative indicators and categorization that you can find (speed, techniques, change over time etc.)
        - What if you made the audience more general? This sounds really interesting but I don't know really anything about rock climbing. If you go for a broader audience you could reach more people
        - Have you tried considering looking at rock climbers in other cities than New York. It might be interesting to see the difference in these variables between multiple cities
        - IL: What if you can gather information about the background of new comers into this sports (what exercise they used to do. Why they decided to come this way)
        - IL: Have you tried contacting sports scientist in person?
        - What if you approached this popular sport with the inherent growth and variability that happens during learning and training (skill+experience+speed)/goal) = your project guide. Because there are a number of parts influencing each other, users could find themselves in an exploratory space that has a starting point, an objective, and a path to getting there. Ratings/speed/olympic data could be quantitative assessment to accomplish this
        - What if the experience was climbing downward instead of upward?
        - Have you tried ioT tracking device research that climbers would carry with them to map their journeys?
        - Have you considered comparing gym climbers to crag climbers?
        - What if: the elite climbers are just better at athletics in general? Would there be a way to show/visualise the controlling factors between elite and non-elite?
        - Have you tried: looking at similar speed-sports and how they show differences? I remember the Times doing it for elite runners: http://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/08/05/sports/olympics/the-100-meter-dash-one-race-every-medalist-ever.html? 
        - Have you tried exploring existing datasets to see how information is collected to determine the level of possible analysis? For example, is technique or forearm strength a measured statistic?

- hollow hold position vs other position (ie feet back/ergular)?

- finger size? cf Sam needs data! lol
