*Cliff/Julian, re: industry:*
1. In as few words as possible, how would you describe
    - climbing?
    - what you do?

`Cliff:`
- climbing is a lifestyle 
    - sport, for sure
    - very all encompassing

- routesetting as main contribution
    - contributing a space for the climbing lifestyle
    - more than just a business

`Julian:`
- Owner's of GP
- extension of search for happiness
- challenge body & mind

2. thesis synopsis + some brief findings, re: industry
    - what do you think?
    - anything glaring missing?

`Cliff:`
- more people just as strong
- maturing sport
- it'll be a while before it goes up 6 grades

3. How would you describe the growth of the climbing industry?
4. How/Why do you think this growth contributes to stronger climbing?

`Cliff:`
- more people
- more maturiy
- more efficiency
- more motivators

`Julian:`
- become main stream. doesn't really like it
    - mega facilities
    - corporate
    - not focused on experience and ethos of climbing, and community building
- loss of main core values of what climbing really is
- becoming larger has increased access to various communities, which helps find "strength" in differnt places
- increased audience

5. Apart from climbing types (lead vs boulder), are there types of gyms?
    - eg think planet fitness vs gold's gym

`Cliff:`
- yeah there are differences
    - think GP
    change focus of why we're here

6. Some obvious trends include gender and racial gaps (until now, predominantly white male sport)
    - are there trends that you know of?

`Cliff:`
- trending in positive direction
- oudoor industry as a whole is getting better

- Do you think addressing negative trends helps contribute to the growth of the sport?

`Julian:`
- has seen change toward diversity and communitis
    - outdoors, etc
- can be better, canbe faster
- industry is very reactionnary, not proactive
    - if 2020 hadn't happened, would the change be different

- worried about more traffic = more population
    - people who are actually part of community are getting overwhelmed
    - can be a detriment

- indsutry can be focused on just money
    - not on building/growing the outdoor climber manners

7. climbing has taken aspects from other sports to improve (chalk, strength training, etc)
    - are there other areas that you think climbing borrows from?
    - do you think climbing gives as much as it receives?

`Cliff:`
- cultural crossovers w/ other sports (eg skating, surfing)
- reverse gymnastics to cliff

`Julian:`
- climbing has adapted more than its given back
    - training for climbing relatively new
    - still a young sport

- alpinism/mountaineering were the original
    - has evolved and been split into more specific things eg: sport/bouldering

- has taken mental coaching/visualizing 
    - training mental athleter
    - developing strategy etc
- eg integrating heart rate monitors 
    - managing pump

8. what aspects of the industry do you think contributes most to climbing strength and why?
    - eg gyms/comps, trainers/research, hold makers, shoes/chalk, etc

`Cliff:`
- gyms
    - access to the gym

`Julian:`
- looks at it with 2 components
- people & tools
- people - main elements
    - the climber
    - eg 2 hr marathon breaking
    - "to be a good rock climber, you have to climb outside"
    - "not just pulling hard, crimping - its everything; nutrition, getting tired on the hike in, mats, safety"
