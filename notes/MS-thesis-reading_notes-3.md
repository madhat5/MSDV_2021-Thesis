-  According to the Association of British Climbing Walls (ABC), there were a million visits to indoor walls in 2017, about 100,000 of us climb regularly, and the numbers are growing by 15-20% a year. The sport will get another boost in 2020, when it makes its debut at the Olympics. In 2015, pushing for it to be included, the International Federation of Sport Climbing estimated there were 35 million climbers worldwide.

- Enthusiasts with big homes and deep wallets are even installing their own private walls. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, put one in the barn of his Yorkshire home and said he used it to teach his children “fear management”.

- “It’s not just about working your body, though that’s where the most obvious benefits are,” says Tiffany Soi, 32, an impressively toned competitive climber who also runs specialised yoga classes. “For a lot of people, it’s very much a therapy.”
