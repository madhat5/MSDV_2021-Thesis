- Max Force vs RFD => 2 distinct measurables

- `anthropometric?`

- climbing ability could be assessed by three components, labeled as training, muscle, and
anthropometry (Magiera 2013)

- bouldering => key variable in climbing high level

- bouldering attemps split btw dynamic and static phases

- rate of force development (RFD) = change of force over time
    - bouldering requires *strong fast*

- `max force & rfd`

- 2 sub studies
    1. max force + rfd across diff levels (`should i focus on this?`)
    2. increase above in elite level

- 31 subjects split by levels (fb ratings)
    - novice, skilled, elite
    - `what where skill levels?`

- max force + rfd measured with *PGM dynamometer calibrated at a frequency of 1000 Hz*
    - RFD measured 50ms, 100ms, 200ms (most reliable is 200ms)

- `what is?` 95% of the Fmax (RFD95%)?

- testing done both intra-session and inter-session
    - btw sessions vs start/end of session

- `is there a way to increase to RFD to a perceived ceiling where lack of technique/experience is the contributing factor?`
    - does that even matter?

- 2nd sub study focused on 14 climbers
    - 2 groups: 7 with protocol + climb, 7 with no specific protocol

- protocol 3x/week for 4 weeks
    - 2 series of 6 sets
    - each series has 3 sets per grip type (3 open hand, 3 half crimp)

- interplay of grip type training. some grips help others (that are non-trained)
    - *working with the half crimp or the slope crimp grip can result in an increase in finger flexor force and rate of force for all grips.*

- `when is the training taking place? before climb, after or separate day?`

> author(s): Eva López-Rivera, Juan José González-Badillo. 2019

- *Intermittent isometric endurance of the forearm flexors is a determinant factor of sport climbing performance.*

- compared 3 hangboard protocols
    - max, intermittent (seems like most productive for endurance), combo

- 26 climbers (avg 7c+/8a)
    - V10/11

- 18mm edges

- intermittent showed effects after 4 weeks. Both/all groups showed improvement after 8

- *However, scientific research focused on optimal training programs and methodology for improving sport performance is still scarce*

- forearm flexor oxidative capacity important rock climbing performance factor

- extra weight delivers documented positive results
    - with loads at 80%+ in experienced athletes/loads for 3-10seconds

- *The best results were found with the program consisting of 4 weeks of MaxHangs using maximal added weight on a medium-depth edge (18 mm, equivalent to one phalange), followed by 4 weeks of MaxHangs on minimal edge depth without added weight.*
    - López-Rivera and González-Badillo (2012)

- intermittent = repeaters

- previous studies tested grip strength (max?) and endurance (not RFD). Focus of this study is endurance
    - 2nd objective to test relationship btw grip endurance and max strength
    - `should I be testing for endurance as well, or just max + RFD?`

- `is my research turning into: what is an effective grip strength method for non-elite climbers?`
    - `or am I testing development of all 3?`

- `studies split more or less`
    - `intro > methods (participants; measures/procedures; analysis) > results > discussion > conclusion`

- participants recruited from the local climbing community
    - had at least 2 yrs experience
    - 7a or greater climbing ability
    - 25+ yrs old
    - no deadhangs for 4 months prior `(difficult to test at gym)?`
    - no injuries
    - measurables include: weight, height, age

- 26 out of 31 completed study
    - `most studies seem to have a small # of women, can I have a more 50/50 group?`

- consent form needed, based on Declaration of Helsinki (ethics)
    - *additional form with their contact details, age, climbing experience, training experience, and climbing ability.*
    - *importance of observing consistent daily habits for the duration of the study.*

- load: 
    - maxHAngs = load defined as weight added to weight belt during hang
    - IntHangs (+Max on min edge) = load defined as edge depth

- half crimp used for training + testing
    - endurance test done on smaller edge (11mm) than training (18mm). avg holds found to be around 15mm
    - `could i test for RFD, Max, Endurance?`

- Randomized accoring to ABCCBA method

- testing conducted on week 0 (start), week 5 (start), week 9(start)

- `use testing and training devices were those proposed by López-Rivera and González-Badillo (2012)?` cf p185
    - also methods/steps for testing days, data recording, etc *!*

- no climbing exercise for 24hrs before test

- Strength test reached within 5 attempts (cf 186)

- dead hangs 2x/week, two 4 week cycles
    - 3-5 sets of 10 s dead-hangs. sets per week increased W1=3; W2=4; W3/4=5
    - either progressive weight load or progressive edge reduction load
    - 3 min rest between sets

- intHangs 3-5 sets. Each set = 4 reps of 10second hangs, 5s rest between. 1min rest. Focused on edge size reduction. 
    - `since intHang is most successful: could I make 2 groups from this, 1 with progressive weight load between sets, 1 without`
    - `or do I do 2 groups, one egde size vs one added weight`
        - `should I add a 3rd group, where split is through sets (eg 2 sets weighted, 2 sets small edge)`
    - `should I increase rest to 3 min?`
    - `should I do 6(9) seconds in the way they do 10(13) seconds?`
    - `should I do 4 sets?`

- workout incorporated into training sessions
    - performed at beginning of workout (aka: warmup, hang, climb)
    - activities outside of hangs were monitored through daily feedback (eg misc training, climbing)
    - *Participants were not allowed to perform any  additional training not prescribed for this study.*
        - `bc my focus is on amateur climbers, this should not be a factor?`

- tech used of stat analysis
    - *Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS; version 17) and Microsoft Excel 2007.*
    - Descriptive stats will be CRUCIAL section

- p188 diagram of study

- *combined with a lower ability to improve endurance levels in boulderers in contrast to sport climbers, due to their more explosive profile*
    - `flip active/rest cycle from 10s/5s to 6s/10s bc bouldering?`
    - `set to 4 (5?) weeks?`

- `should i postule for rest before/after study?`

- *In light of these results, we put forward the suggestion that training strength using dead-hangs, first with added weight and then with small edges, not only develops maximum strength, but also has a notable effect on small-holds grip endurance in climbers.*
    - `make this a focus!!!`

- additional study recommendations
    - *Future studies should include a larger sample size and might be focused on a narrower range of climbing levels than ours*

> src: https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2015/08000/Fingerboard_in_Competitive_Bouldering__Training.26.aspx
    > https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26203738/
> author(s): Jerry P J Medernach, Heinz Kleinöder, Helmut H H Lötzerich. 2015

- intro has description of bouldering as is (down to the mats/height of the walls etc)
    - includes average # of moves (4-8)
    - description of comp

- intro conclusion: *In conclusion, high-intensity forearm muscle contractions, repeated over a relatively long period and separated by short rest periods, suggest that grip endurance can be considered an additional key factor and that rapid recovery after attempt is of particular importance in competitive BL*

- *Results from sport climbing investigations, however, suggest that the trainable variables grip strength and grip endurance are of greater importance in increasing climbing ability compared with anthropometric or flexibility requirements*
    - `possible outgoing discussion topic: what other factors influence climbing ability outside of technique + finger/forearm development? my arg: core, body tension, flexibility. W/  expansion on finger strength makes crucial 4.)`

- provides description and goal of fingerboards
    - sets min skill level at intermediate to attempt fingerboards

- argues boards have been mainly for assessment to dtermine strength/endurance, and not investigated as *training devices to increase grip endurance in competitive BL*

- uses 4-week FB protocol

- `i'm working off assumption that this study proves: FB + climbing > climbing for grip strength`

- selected 23 advanced male boulderers
    - `one goal of my research is to provide more diversity in the studies conducted`
    - 6 people selected at random for retest (ensure reliability), after 48 hrs rest
    - *recruited from local climbing clubs and commercial climbing centers, (c) had to be experienced in regular BL training in the past year (at least 1 training session per week)*

- 3 sessions/wk
    - 2 days rest btw sessions

- tests evaluated
    - grip strength through dynamometer
    - grip endurance to failure
    - dead hangs in 1/2 crimp, open hand, pinch
    - intermittent hangs

- *perceived physical state (PEPS)*
    - `how was this assessed?`
        - *The pretests and posttests included a valid 20-item PEPS questionnaire to assess individual perceived activation (PEPSactivation) and training (PEPStraining) states for both training groups and for the pretests and posttests*

- participants split into random abba groups, btw FB and bouldering (BL)
    - req of no FB protocol in prior 4 weeks
    - `do I want/need this? did the other studies do something similar?`
    - level of at least 7b in previous 6 months (self reported)

- `serious work will have to go into waiver, safety instructions, training instructions`

- tests conducted at same time (18:00-19:00), w/ 48 hrs rest
    - *There was to be no alcohol consumption within 24 hours or caffeine consumption within 2 hours of data collection.*
    - `do i need to go this far?`
    - test structure = warmup, measurables, brush holds, provide chalk (standardized), test
    - 5 min rest btw test sets

- provides dynamometer instructions for proper usage
    - aka no thumb use, forearm isolation, climb grip used
    - tests performed w/ dominant hand only
        - `do i want both?`

- supervision during test
    - `can i recruit high level climbers/former coaches/Cliff/Julien?`

- seems this study was much more specific than the others
    - `could this be bc is was done earlier/had to determine with no precedent the factors that were truly important`

- second mention of *Bonferroni* for ANOVA/MANOVA tests

- *4-week FB regimen is a highly effective training method for increasing grip strength and endurance in competitive BL.*

- *These results confirm our hypothesis that FB leads to higher grip strength gains because specific grip positions are worked maximally until muscle failure*
    - also muscles are isolated

- nobody backked our bc of injury

- *it remains a training supplement that is most effective when implemented in conjunction with the activity of BL*
