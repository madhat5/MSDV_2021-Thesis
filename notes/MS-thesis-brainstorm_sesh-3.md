Sections 2, 3, 4 => thesis treatment (main)




- find a way to visualize aspects of climbs that increase difficulty (eg: angle, hold types, hold size, hold position, material type, etc)

- use app data (Armin's idea)
    - eg moonboard, etc

- research on climbing strength (like my thesis)?

============================================================
1. intro

- intro formulae
    - ab ovo 
    - *in medias res*
        - use this? 
        - with brief narrative of a quick boulder

- (*1) project is about finding out if climbers are getting stronger, or there are more strong climbers
    - by proxy: what is strength (in climbing)?
    - not dealing with 
        - how to get stronger
        - who is the strongest/ever
        - other sports

- (*4) insipiration 
    - came from me/researcher being a climber, in a continuous effort to get stronger
    - questions about benchmarks, and the rate of strength increase/hard climb development

- thesis premises/questions
    - (*2) what is climbing
        - types of climbs?
            - focuse will be on bouldering + sport/lead. why?
        - climbing vocab?
            - holds/types
            - misc terms (ascent, onsite/flash, red point, etc)
    - (*5) climbing strength
        - what are the benchmarks around the world?
        - how is it measured?
        - what makes a climb hard?
            - how are they graded?
        - how do climbers get stronger?

- (*3) cultural and historical background
    - sources (list)

- (*6) method
    - how will i approach topic?
    - what point of view will i use?
        - use narrative method here?


- `intro wire`
    1. in media res narrative: describe sending a clinmb in the gym (hold, foot, looking to next, keep tension, etc)
    2. answer what is climbing? (*2)
        - in general + cultural/hist bacgkground (*3)
        - types (focus: lead/sport + boulder)
        - misc terms (ascent, onsite/flash, red point, etc)
    3. leads into project topic (*1)
        - brief inspiration section as lead into (*4) 
        - what is strength in climbing? are we getting stronger, or are there more strong climbers?
    5. climbing strength (*5)
    6. recall (1/2) and expand on method the project will pursue (*6)
